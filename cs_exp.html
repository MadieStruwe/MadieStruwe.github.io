      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Some Major Computer Science Projects I have worked on</i></p><br>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Human Centered Computing</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">In this class students learned about human-computer interaction, and techniques of user-centered design.  While the final project had no coding, students still learned prototyping techniques. </p>
      	<p class="w3-justify">The entire class was presented 3 different technologies and we needed to incorporate two of these into our project. My team chose the topics 3D printing and VR. Our idea was to have a user enter virtual reality and be able to sculpt anything they want as if they were in an art studio. </p>
      	<p class="w3-justify">We went through many iterations of prototyping and taking feedback from users. Our prototyping sessions were with paper and props. We had glasses and gloves laid out for the user after they put these on, they “entered” virtual reality and we displayed a menu to them with options and tools for them to pick up. While the user worked, we took notes and everything they did, from everything that was intuitive from things they struggled with. We then go verbal feedback from the user about their experience. Using their feedback we improved on our prototype for the next iteration. </p>
      	<h4 class="w3-wide">Tools Picked Up </h4>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Brain Storming</li>
      		<li>Prototyping</li>
      	</ul>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Intro to Robotics</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify"> In my Intro to Robotics class, for the first part of the semester, we learned various techniques to program a <a href = “http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/” target=”_blank”> Sparki</a> robot to do various things, starting from following a line to having Sparki show where it is in relation to the world. At the end of the semester, students we grouped into teams to design and execute a final project using the techniques they were taught and expanding upon them. </p>
      	<p class="w3-justify"> My team worked on a project revolving around Computer Vision. We designed a game for two Sparki bots to play. The goal for the robots was to find colored blocks and push them to their goal zones.  </p>
		<p class="w3-justify">After calibrating a web camera, we identified the colored blocks visible as blobs to the Sparki blocks. The Sparki bots used Dijkstra’s algorithm to move to one block, pick it up, move to the goal zone, put down the block, and move to the next block.  </p>
		<p class="w3-justify">I am currently working on locating all the files for this class and project and putting them into a GitHub repo <a href = "https://github.com/MadieStruwe/CSCI-3302-Introduction-to-Robotics" target="_blank"> here. </a> </p>
		<h4 class="w3-wide">Tools Picked Up </h4>
      	<ul>
      		<li>OpenCV</li>
      	</ul>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Software Development Methods and Tools</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">In this class we covered the tools and methods used for software development. The students were assigned groups to work together to make some sort of application. </p>
      	<p class="w3-justify">My group made an application based on maintenance requests. The idea behind it was to allow students to submit a maintenance request, such as a flickering light bulb, to maintenance staff, and to let the maintenance staff access the requests and mark their status. </p>
      	<p class="w3-justify">To learn about this course project, you can check out the GitHub repo <a href = "https://github.com/Earth-Dimension-C-137" target="_blank"> here. </a> </p>

      	</ul>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Data Mining</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">In this class we learned basic data mining concepts and techniques for discovering interesting patterns hidden in large-scale data sets. We got in groups and discussed a data mining project to do. </p>
    		<p class="w3-justify">My team decided to work with avocado data sets. The goal of our project is to discover the correlation between the weather affecting avocado farms in California and avocado prices across the United States. </p>
    		<p class="w3-justify">I worked on the project with my team. To check out our current GitHub repo you can click <a href = "https://github.com/MadieStruwe/The-Avocadoers" target="_blank"> here. </a> </p>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Computer Animations</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">In this class we learn about techniques and principles in computer animations. Our final project is to animate a photo-realistic room. </p>
  		<p class="w3-justify">The room I have created is inspired by the <a href = "http://www.saic.edu/saicballroomrental/" target="_blank"> SAIC Ballroom. </a> </p>
  		<p class="w3-justify">My GitHub repo mainly contains notes I took in the class. To check out my current GitHub repo you can click <a href = "https://github.com/MadieStruwe/CSCI-4809-Computer-Animations" target="_blank"> here. </a> The final video rendering of the ballroom is below: </p>
