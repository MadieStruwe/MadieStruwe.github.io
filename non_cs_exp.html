      <h3 class="w3-wide">Why Nordic Studies? </h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">While taking classes at CU Boulder, I knew I needed to take a language course and some general education courses. For the language course, I wanted to take something I wanted to learn, as a result, I took Swedish. During my two years of Swedish classes, I came to appreciate the Swedish culture and history. As a result, I decided to take other "Scandinavian" classes for my general education courses. After looking at the requirements for a Nordic Studies Minor, I discovered that I have already taken most of the classes I needed. As such, I decided to get a Nordic Studies minor. </p>
