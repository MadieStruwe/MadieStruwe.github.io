    	<p class="w3-justify">
        My name is Madelaine Struwe, and just 
        like everyone else, my story begins 
        at birth. A couple of hours before 
        Mother's Day the world welcomed me, 
        whether it was ready or not. I was 
        born in Chicago, Illinois but when I 
        was 4 years old my family moved to 
        Colorado and I have lived here ever 
        since. Growing up I wanted to be an 
        artist, but I also wanted to enlist 
        in the Marines when I was old enough. 
        I always felt like I was on track with 
        my dreams, I was drawing all the time 
        and even joined a youth program called 
        the <a href="https://www.youngmarines.com/" 
        target="_blank"> Young Marines. </a> </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        I joined the Young Marines in 6th grade 
        and stayed until I completed high school. 
        I worked hard while I was in the program, 
        I challenged myself physically and 
        mentally as I worked my way up the ranks 
        and traveled to different "Leadership 
        Academies" across the county. While in 
        high school, I also wanted to try playing 
        a sport, as such I tried out for my high 
        school football team. I became the first 
        girl to join the team, and I continued to 
        challenge myself physically to stay at the 
        same level as my fellow teammates. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        As I approached my high school graduation, 
        I attempted to get into the Military 
        Academies to continue down my path. 
        However, even with a Congressional 
        Nomination, I could not get in, and I was 
        set on a slow path to realizing that life 
        does not go the way you plan all the time. 
        I made plans to attend the University of 
        Colorado at Boulder to go down a new path. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> 
        I began taking classes at CU in the fall 
        of 2012. In December 2018, I graduated 
        from CU Boulder with a BA in Computer 
        Science and a minor in Nordic Studies. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-wide">Where I Went to School</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          In Fall 2012 I began taking classes at 
          CU Boulder for a degree in Mechanical 
          Engineering. However, as I took more 
          classes in that field, I realized that 
          is not what I wanted to be doing. I 
          knew I liked putting things together 
          and doing puzzles, so I had to think, 
          "What major would be right for me?" I 
          decided to transfer to Computer Science, 
          and although some of the classes have 
          been difficult, I have enjoyed taking 
          them more. What attracted me to Computer 
          Science was it seemed to be like a puzzle, 
          and I was trying to solve it by putting 
          the pieces together. To me, it seems like 
          Computer Science gives you a problem and 
          asks you to solve it. While a lot can be 
          frustrating, it is satisfying to finally 
          have the answer, and sometimes it is fun 
          putting the pieces together. </p>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Classes I Have Taken</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          Regarding my Computer Science classes, 
          I have taken the intro level course offered 
          at CU and worked my way to upper division 
          classes that appealed to my interests. To 
          name some of the classes I have taken:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discreet Mathematics</li>
          <li>Algorithms</li>
          <li>Introduction to Robotics</li>
          <li>Software Development Methods and Tools</li>
          <li>Computer Graphics</li>
          <li>Computer Animations</li>

      <h3 class="w3-wide">Projects I Have Worked On During College</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          While taking these Computer Science classes, 
          I have been able to work on school projects 
          that challenged me, but also exposed me to 
          new libraries and software. One project 
          entailed writing a program for Sparki Robots 
          to play a game using computer vision. 
          Another project focused on working in a 
          group to develop a web app. Some of the 
          tools I have picked up because of these 
          projects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OpenCV</li>
          <li>OpenGL</li>
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Maya</li>
          <li>GitHub</li>

  	  <h3 class="w3-wide">Projects I Have Worked On Outside of College</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          After graduating from college, I have been 
          given the oportunity to work on other 
          projects of my choosing. I have decided to
          try to create my own video game, as well
          as coding some old classic games. Stay tuned
          to see my projects when I finish them. 
          As a result of working on these projects, I 
          have been learning to use the following 
          tools and languages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unity</li>
          <li>C#</li>

      <h3 class="w3-wide">Minor</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify"> 
          While taking classes at CU Boulder, I 
          knew I needed to take a language course 
          and some general education courses. For 
          the language course, I wanted to take 
          something I wanted to actually learn, 
          as a result, I took Swedish. During my 
          two years of Swedish classes, I came to 
          appreciate the Swedish culture and 
          history. As a result, I decided to take 
          "Scandinavian" classes for my general 
          education courses. After looking at the 
          requirements for a Nordic Studies Minor, 
          I discovered that I have already taken 
          most of the classes I needed. As such, 
          I decided to get a Nordic Studies minor. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-wide">Writing Classes</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          Even as a Computer Science Major, 
          written and verbal communication is still 
          extremely important. I have taken a few 
          writing courses while attending CU. I have 
          taken a couple official "Writing" courses 
          at CU. One class was about comic books and 
          graphic novels, and to how those are valid 
          forms of books and not as just a means of 
          simple entertainment. Another class I took 
          allowed me to write a scientific paper of 
          my own choosing. I decided to write a 
          refutation against Nick Bostrom as to why 
          AI is nothing to fear. </p>
      	<p class="w3-justify"> 
          A couple other courses I took, while not 
          technically a Writing course, entailed 
          higher level writing and thinking not 
          normally engaged by a Computer Science 
          Classes One course was a History course 
          and the other was a Geography course. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-wide">Video Games</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          Some of my earliest memories revolve around
           video games. My first game console was the 
           Nintendo Entertainment System, I enjoyed 
           playing games such as Castlevania and The 
           Legend of Zelda. Although at the time I was 
           not very good, but, much like with everything 
           else, practice makes perfect. Over the years 
           I came into my own as a gamer. </p>
        <p class="w3-justify">
          I can say that my favorite game of all time is
           Resident Evil 2 (1998). Moving the characters
            is like moving a tank, and the graphics don't 
            stand up to today’s standards. However, I 
            enjoyed the story and having 2 playable 
            characters to choose from. But both characters 
            need to be played with, in a Scenario A and 
            Scenario B to get the full ending. Depending 
            on which character and the choices you made 
            during the first play through, the story changes
            for the second character. Playing a game like 
            that was extremely different and revolutionary. </p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Some other games and game series I really enjoy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assassin's Creed</li>
          <li>Bayonetta</li>
          <li>Devil May Cry</li>
          <li>Fallout</li>
          <li>God of War</li>
          <li>The Legend of Zelda</li>
          <li>Resident Evil</li>
        </ul>
       <h3 class="w3-wide">Artwork</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          I have always enjoyed drawing since I was a child. 
          One of my favorite classes from elementary through 
          high school was art class. Today I do not have 
          time to do as much drawing as I use to, however I 
          still like to occasinally let my creative juices 
          flow by drawing on my computer with my tablet. 
          Stay tuned for artwork! </p>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Play Games with My Friends</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          I enjoy getting together with my friends to play
          games. We usually play tabletop games like Dungeon 
          and Dragons. In a typical month, I will get together 
          every other Sunday with my friends and run a 
          campaign for them to play through as the Dungeon 
          Master. On the weeks where I am not leading the 
          campaign, I enjoy playing. Being a player encourages 
          teamwork and problem-solving. Being the Dungeon Master 
          allows me to make a world for the players to navigate 
          through. I have learned how to make the world more 
          "accessible" to players with how I describe things to 
          them, and how to adjust things on the fly if something 
          is too difficult for them to overcome. </p>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Playing with My Dogs</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          The one constant thing in my life is my dogs. 
          No matter how long I am gone, or what kind of 
          day I have had, my dogs always remain so happy 
          to see me. To my dogs, I am the center of their 
          lives, and to show them how much I love them,
          I enjoy playing with them, spoiling them with 
          different flavored treats, and just being with 
          them.  It is still a mystery to me of, "What 
          have I done to deserve two amazing dogs?"</p>
      <h3 class="w3-wide">Putting Things Together</h3>
      	<p class="w3-justify">
          I have always enjoyed putting things together, 
          whether it is furniture or a small figurine. 
          To me, there is something extremely satisfying 
          about putting things together, not just the 
          outcome, but the whole process of assembling 
          items is relaxing. I even enjoy putting 
          together the dreaded IKEA furniture. I hear 
          horror stories about people losing pieces or 
          having extras, I can say that neither has 
          happened to me. </p>
